Maybe the reasoning is that, if they haven't seen the movies, that they can't comment on these other questions. There might be exceptions to this, so we might want to check if that is the case later.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some NaN results for the `Which of the following Star Wars films have you seen? Please select all that apply.` column, and there are unnamed columns that are near that seem to be asking the same question, the separation must have come from a checkbox method of answering the question. Luckily we can tell what the column is intended for by the data entry, for example, entries for the column `Unnamed: 4` are all either NaN or \"Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones\", so we know that this column is for Star Wars Episode 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Please rank the Star Wars films in order of preference with 1 being your favorite film in the franchise and 6 being your least favorite film.` column is similarly broken into six columns, though now we have to assume that column 1 is for Starwars I, column 6 in this set is Starwars VI, and that the columns inetween are in the correct order. We'll want to find if there is a way to check this.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Please state whether you view the following characters favorably, unfavorably, or are unfamiliar with him/her.` column is a bit trickier, with it being separated into 14 columns and the responses recorded in the data being along the lines of \"Somewhat favorably\", leaving us with no indication of which character the column refers to. We will definitely want to see if we can check which column is responsible for which character.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some NaN values in the `Do you consider yourself to be a fan of the Expanded Universe?` column that seem weird considering that there are also Yes and No answers. Perhaps NaN is to indicate a third option: I know nothing about the expanded universe.\n",
